# Soil

The foundational elements for starting responsive HTML5/SASS projects. Based on MNML by mrmrs - [http://mn-ml.cc](http://mn-ml.cc). Includes some other fun modules that I like to use, including [css-wizardry grids](http://csswizardry.com/csswizardry-grids/) and [fluidity](http://fluidity.sexy/).

# Getting started

* Create a new repo for your project on Github
* In terminal run
```bash
    git clone git@github.com:topherauyeung/soil.git yourNewRepoName
    cd yourNewRepoName
    rm -rf .git
    git init
    git remote add origin git@github.com:yourUserName/yourNewRepoName.git
```

* git remote -v will allow you to check that you have changed the remote origin correctly. The output should look like:
```bash
    origin git@github.com:yourUserName/yourNewRepoName.git (fetch)
    origin git@github.com:yourUserName/yourNewRepoName.git (push)
```

## Dev environment
To set up a convenient dev environment run this at the root of soil

```bash
    npm install .
    npm install -g gulp
```

Then run

```
    gulp
```

Gulp is a javascript task runner. It compiles sass, lints the compiled css, and sets up a livereload server so you can save your fingers from pressing âŒ˜+r

* Once you add & commit files you are ready to publish run:
```bash
git push -u origin master
```

# What is it?

Mostly a bare-bones html5 template with some basic sass partials that
I use to start prototypes with. Also includes automated tasks for
sass compilation, css linting, css minification, and livereload integration.

## Rake tasks

Start sass development - watches the sass folder and updates css/i.css with every file change
```bash
rake sass
```

Start sass - output is minified to css/i.css
```bash
rake minify
```
